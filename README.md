store. Each book is classified under a “subject” to enable subject searches.
- Members: This table records information about members of the application.
Each member chooses their own email address (unique) and password at the time of
registration. UserId is auto-incremented and automatically created by the database.
The email address is unique in the member's table.
- Orders: This table records information about orders placed by members
place orders. The orders may contain one or more books, and the details of the
order are kept in a separate table. A unique order number is generated by the
system.
- OrderDetails: This table records information about each order, including the
isbn and quantity of books in the order.
- Cart: This table contains isbn and quantity of each book placed in the
shopping cart of a member. Once a member checks out, the shopping cart is
emptied and an order is created
